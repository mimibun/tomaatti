# tomaatti 🍅 a simple pomodoro timer
> what is this?
- this is a simple [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer. the pomodoro technique is a system to help people concentrate by dividing work into usually managable/short blocks, to make focusing easier, as the blocks are short and seperated by short breaks.
> why did you make this project?
- i'm using the pomodoro technique and have used various timers online, but i found them to be a bit too bloated or complicated and also didn't allow for setting the right alarm sounds. additionally, i wanted to practice my coding, get more familiar with svelte and also design something, and thus i decided to make this timer be a thing.
## features
- looks cool and nice! ✨
- dark mode by default!
- self-made alarm sound (by me!)
- customisable pomodoro cycle (duration and order)
- adjustable volume!
- select your alarm sound! (i'll add more soon!)
